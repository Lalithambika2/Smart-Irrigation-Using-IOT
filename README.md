# Smart-Irrigation-Using-IOT

Introduction
The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT-based project designed to optimize water usage in agriculture, enhance crop productivity, and reduce environmental impact. This project leverages sensors, real-time data analysis, and automated controls to provide intelligent irrigation management.

Features
Real-time monitoring of environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
Automatic control of water supply based on sensor data.
Remote access and control using a web or mobile interface.
Notifications and alerts for critical conditions (e.g., low soil moisture).
Data analytics and historical insights for better decision-making.
Objectives
Efficient Water Usage: Reduce water wastage by delivering the right amount of water when needed.
Sustainable Agriculture: Promote environmentally friendly farming practices.
Farmer Empowerment: Provide actionable insights and tools for better decision-making.
Technologies Used
Hardware:

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP8266/ESP32).
Soil moisture sensor.
DHT11/DHT22 (temperature and humidity sensor).
Water pump and relay module.
Power supply unit.
Software:

IoT Platform (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak, or MQTT).
Programming Language: Python/C++ (for microcontroller programming).
Web/Mobile App for remote monitoring (optional).
Communication Protocols:

Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for real-time data transmission.
How It Works
Sensors collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
The microcontroller processes the sensor data and determines the irrigation requirement.
Based on predefined thresholds, the system activates the water pump automatically.
Data is transmitted to an IoT platform, enabling users to monitor and control the system remotely.
Alerts and notifications are sent to the user for specific conditions, like low water levels or malfunction.
System Architecture
Sensors Layer: Collects real-time environmental data.
Controller Layer: Processes sensor data and controls actuators (water pump).
Communication Layer: Sends data to the cloud and receives control commands.
Cloud Layer: Stores data, provides analytics, and enables remote access.
User Interface: A mobile/web application for monitoring and controlling the system.
